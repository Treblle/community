## Content Preparation:

- Document Format: Please use Google Docs for your blog post. Please make sure we have view permission to your document.
- Include relevant images, gifs, or screenshots to enhance your blog's visual appeal.
- Share personal experiences or insights where applicable to give your blog a unique touch.
- Consider adding code samples, examples, or practical demonstrations to illustrate concepts.
- We encourage you to use AI for research and reference purposes. However, please submit original, human-written content.

## **Plagiarism Check:**
Ensure your content is original by checking it for plagiarism. You can use a plagiarism checker like [QUILBOT](https://quillbot.com/ai-content-detector) and share a screenshot showing the plagiarism percentage (ideally 25% max).

## **Collaboration & Avoiding Duplicates:**

Claiming an Issue: If you'd like to write about a specific blog post topic, comment on the issue with a brief outline of your planned table of contents. This helps prevent two contributors from working on similar content.
